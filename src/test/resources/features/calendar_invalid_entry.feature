Feature:  As a user, I should see error messages when entering an invalid integer into the calendar repeat day input box.

  AC : Users see error messages for entering invalid integers.
  If enters less than 1 —> user should see “The value have not to be less than 1.”
  If enters more than 99 —> user should see “The value have not to be more than 99.”
  Negative Scenarios:
  If enters special character-> error message should be displayed.
  If enters letters - error message should be displayed
  If no input is put in the days box -> error message should be displayed.
  [Note: no need to test valid number, data type, etc in this story.]

  Accounts are: Drivers, Store Managers, Sales Managers
