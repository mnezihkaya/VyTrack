Feature: CY19-67 / As a user, I want to view columns on the Vehicle models page.
  AC #1: The store manager and sales manager should see 10 columns on the Vehicle Model page.
  Expected Column names:
  MODEL NAME, MAKE, CAN BE REQUESTED, CVVI, CO2 FEE (/MONTH), COST (DEPRECIATED),
  TOTAL COST (DEPRECIATED), CO2 EMISSIONS, FUEL TYPE, VENDORS

  AC #2: Drivers should not able to access the Vehicle Model page, users should see
  “You do not have permission to perform this action.”

    Given user '<username>' login to the Dashboard
    When user on Dashboard page
