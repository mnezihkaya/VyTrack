Feature: As a user, I want to learn how to use the Pinbar.

  AC1: when users click click the “Learn how to use this space” link on the homepage, users should see:
  “How To Use Pinbar” and “Use pin icon on the right top corner of the page to create fast access link in the pinbar.”

  AC2: users should see an image on the page.
  [in automation testing, just verify the image source.]
